# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Landing Page

Welcome to my responsive, cleanly designed **portfolio landing page** project. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and frontend layout design as part of a web development learning journey—built with a modern aesthetic and simple structure.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── index.html         # Main HTML structure of the landing page
├── style.css          # Styling using modern flexbox and grid layout
├── Photos/            # Folder containing headshot and skill logos (not included here)
```

## 🎨 Features

- 🖼️ Hero section with personal headshot and call to action  
- 💡 Skill section with logos (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python)
